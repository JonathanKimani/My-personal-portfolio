<h1>Skills I Have acquired</h1>
<P>My are built on three things that have helped me throught my journey. Art and creativity have been one of the skills i have had to apply throught my high school as an art student and problem-solving which has significantly helped me through my love for math making math one of my favorite subjects.
     Through creativity i have been able to work on many projects in school and put of school. My skills are more than art/creativity,it also includes my skil of persuation whether its peoples opinions or actions which has proven to ben very usefull throught my days in school and even outside the school 
     compound, I excel at all of this skils which have proven to bee very helpfull for me and those around me. Finally, my problem-solving skills helps me belive that software engineering is for me, cause it dosent mainly involve programing more of solving problembs brought out by bugs or errors that
      are brought out while programing.
