    <h3>A Bit About Me</h3>
    <p>I'm a fresh IGCSE graduate who's diving headfirst into the world of software engineering. When I'm not learning how to code or pretending to understand the lessons,  you'll find me exploring music and art<br>
     – because creativity and music make surprisingly good roommates in my brain. I'm basically that person who listens to music all day.Oh, and I'm very curious about  much everything, which means I probably <br>
     have 47 browser tabs open right now researching random stuff.</p>
    <p>Stick around and you'll get the full in depth tour of my journey so far. From my educational foundation to the skills I'm building, plus all the random interests that keep my brain entertained when it's not ,<br>
    dealing with school. Think of this as a digital area where you can learn more about me– you'll see what I've learned, what I'm passionate about, what makes me mad, and probably way too many details about my <br>
    latest works. Whether you're here to check out my projects, see if youre intrested in any of my hobbies, or just want to watch someone struggle and figure out this whole "portfolio thing" thing in real time,<br>
     you're in for a journey.Plus, you might actually discover we have more in common than you think – like an unhealthy addiction to music or random stuff. So grab some coffee (or tea, I don't judge) and dive in,<br>
